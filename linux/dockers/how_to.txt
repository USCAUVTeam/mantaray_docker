First, run docker compose build
Then, run docker compose up
Wait until the docker compose finishes. This is usually when the container for the rpi finishes running catkin build. 
Next, run docker ps. This should output all of the running docker containers. Copy the container id of the image dockers-rpi
Enter the docker container by running docker exec -it <container id> bash
This will put you in a bash terminal of the container. 
Now, cd into catkin_ws and run source devel/setup.bash
This will let you run roslaunch mantaray_rpi mantaray.launch
